        <p>At the <strong> Africa Institute for Health Policy Foundation </strong> (AIHP) we recognize that health organizations are operating in an increasingly complex environment characterized by uncertainty and constant evolution. The business as usual approach is no longer tenable, AIHP works with other stakeholders in the Africa’s health landscape to anticipate these changes and adapt accordingly through the adoption of targeted innovations. The AIHP experts have an in-depth understanding of the Africa’s health landscape and an adaptable outlook that allows for meaningful implementation even in the most complex environments.
        </br>
        </br>
        We partner with others to create scalable solutions for the pressing population health challenges facing the African continent. AIHP flagship interventions embrace a holistic approach to the health system, covering all its components ranging from closing the gaps in service delivery and human resources to bridging the health technology and information divide.

                    <p>AIHP organizes the Health Incubator Summit focused on health system innovations in Africa. The summit brings together promising entrepreneurs, practitioners, policy-makers, academics to build capacity and scale effective health interventions. In this quest our efforts are ambitious and our resources limited.  Therefore we believe that sustainable impactful change should and will happen without us.  By bringing together policy makers, entrepreneurs and practitioners within a community building framework; expertise and talent will drive creative interventions and solutions. The first Summit was held in Mozambique on the 10th October 2013 in partnership with the University St. Thomas of Mozambique.  </p>

                    <p>Having a skilled workforce is as important as having the right medicines and technologies for service delivery. At AIHP we embrace a strong partnership model to provide a comprehensive package of specialist health services coupled with a supportive referral structure to those in need. Our focus is on both rural and urban areas across Africa- where we partner with others within government, private sector and civil society to provide high quality diagnostic and treatment services. To alleviate the access to care constraints imposed by limited financial resources; we readily embrace appropriate innovations ranging from leveraging telemedicine capabilities of our partners to practical financing solutions in order to facilitate service delivery across different platforms of care.</p>

At AIHP we leverage our comparative advantages and of our partners to offer practical training in critical areas of the health system. We cover areas as disparate as executive training for health system managers and on-hand clinical skills development for frontline health workers at different levels. The Educational and Training component is strongly linked to our health service delivery initiatives at different levels of care.</p>

In an attempt to address this challenge; we leverage telemedicine as a medium for both service delivery and training of health workers to bridge the existing health inequalities. We aim to partner with different stakeholders to cover critical areas in both diagnostic, preventative and treatment services. Our goal is to reach those in marginalized parts of the continent as a pathway towards Universal Health Coverage.</p>
